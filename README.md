The project focuses on sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing and classifying the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.

The notebook is divided into four sections:

LSTM and Attention Model Training: This section demonstrates the training of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Attention models for sentiment analysis. It includes variations of the models with and without text cleaning.

GRU Model: In this section, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model is implemented for sentiment analysis. GRU is another type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

RNN Model: The RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model is implemented in this section. RNNs are a class of neural networks that are suitable for processing sequential data by maintaining a hidden state.

Transfer Learning with LSTM and Attention Models: This section explores transfer learning techniques using the LSTM and Attention models trained in Section 1. It includes four variations of transfer learning, with and without text cleaning.

The code includes importing and downloading necessary libraries, such as numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, and keras-self-attention. It also defines user-defined functions for tweet cleansing or data cleaning, which involves removing punctuation, digits, and stop words, as well as stemming the words.

The project utilizes publicly available datasets from Kaggle for training and evaluating the models. The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the code and its implementation for sentiment analysis using different approaches.
